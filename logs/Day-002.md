# 100 Days of Code
## Day 2 - Monday, October 3, 2017
I am getting my GitHub repo setup and working with GitHub Desktop.  I am also apparently trying Markdown for the first time too.

I normally use SourceTree and BitBucket server, but I would like to try GitHub's tools.

I am even going to try [Atom](https://atom.io/), although I will keep [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ready just in case.  :)

I will be taking a look at Ionic and will be reading [Building Mobile Apps with Ionic](https://www.joshmorony.com/building-mobile-apps-with-ionic-2/) by Josh Morony.

I got this book a year ago and haven't made the time to get past the first couple chapters.
